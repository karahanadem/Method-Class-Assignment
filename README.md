# Math Operations Application

A simple C# console application that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including class creation, method implementation, and different ways to call methods with parameters.

## Project Description

This application was created to demonstrate the following C# programming concepts:

1. Creating a class with methods
2. Implementing a void method that takes multiple parameters
3. Instantiating a class
4. Calling methods with positional parameters
5. Calling methods with named parameters

## Features

- **MathOperations Class**: Contains a method that performs mathematical operations
- **ProcessNumbers Method**: Takes two integers, squares the first one and displays both numbers
- **Parameter Demonstration**: Shows how to call methods using both positional and named parameters
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Each line and block of code is thoroughly commented for educational purposes

## Code Structure

The application consists of two main classes:

1. **Program Class**: Contains the Main method (entry point of the application)
2. **MathOperations Class**: Contains the ProcessNumbers method that performs the required operations

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

## Sample Output

```
Math Operations Application
---------------------------

Calling method with positional parameters:
The square of the first number (5) is: 25
The second number is: 10

Calling method with named parameters:
The square of the first number (8) is: 64
The second number is: 16

Press any key to exit...
```

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or higher
- Any operating system that supports .NET (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as an educational example for:
- Understanding class and method creation in C#
- Learning how parameters work in methods
- Seeing the difference between positional and named parameters
- Following good coding practices with proper comments
